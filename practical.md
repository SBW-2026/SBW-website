### by bus: 

You take the **bus number 6 or 9 to Saluhallen** and make your way from there. 

### by car: 

Parking in central Uppsala is not very easy, but there are a few parking garages around the train station. From there you can walk to the dinner venue (see above). 

A parking garage that usually has vacancies is located at Kungsgatan 89. One of the closest parking garages is the one under S:t Per Gallerian, located at Dragarbrunnsgatan 21.
