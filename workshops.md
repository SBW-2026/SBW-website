<p style="font-style: italic;">How Lego can improve your research, or what everyone should understand about data documentation, metadata and making research reproducible.
</p>

<p>The workshop will provide insights into the importance of data documentation. You [the participants] will learn more about metadata and how best to describe scientific data with regard to types, topics and contents.
You [the participants] will have opportunity to discuss aspects of data management such as searching and reusing data, viable file formats, documentation of code and the FAIR data sharing principles (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable).

<p>
This workshop would be given by Andreas Dahlin - Founder of Visualize Your Science
</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">"We all do excellent research that deserves to be presented in the best possible way. We are all good at writing and discussing our findings, but what about making diagrams, illustrations, and result charts? Using clear, crisp, and pedagogic images is one of the most powerful methods of explaining your research."
</p>
 
<p>
In this lecture, Andreas will share his knowledge of making scientific drawings and answer the following questions:
 
1. How do I draw?
2. What to draw?
3. How can I make my images scientifically credible?
4: How do I ensure my images communicate what I want them to communicate?
