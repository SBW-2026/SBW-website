**Dr. Kaisa Thorell, University of Gothenburg**

We are delighted to announce that Dr. Kaisa Thorell from the University of Gothenburg will host an inspiring workshop on Bacterial Genomics: From Data to Discovery. Dr. Thorell is a SciLifeLab & Wallenberg DDLS Fellow and a leading expert with more than a decade of experience in bacterial genomics, transcriptomics, and metagenomics. Her work brings together experimental microbiology, comparative genomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning to unravel how bacteria evolve, persist, and drive disease.

Dr. Thorell's career has been defined by pioneering applications of next-generation sequencing—initially in cancer genetics and later in *Helicobacter pylori* genomics—giving her a uniquely rich perspective that spans wet-lab methods, cutting-edge data analysis, and large international collaborations. Her clarity, expertise, and enthusiasm for data-driven microbiology are key reasons she is so highly regarded at the University of Gothenburg.

In this workshop, participants will gain practical skills in genome assembly, annotation, comparative genomics, and best practices in data quality and reproducibility.
