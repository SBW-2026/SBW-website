      <h2>Introduction to SBW2026</h2>
      <p>
        The Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop (SBW) is an annual event organised by different Swedish universities since 2000, and is the largest gathering of bioinformaticians and computational biologists in Sweden.
        The meeting welcomes participants from all career stages and sectors, with a strong focus on PhD students and postdocs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year’s edition will take place in Gothenburg at the Wallenberg Conference Center.
        The programme will feature keynote presentations, contributed talks, hands-on workshops, and a poster session, with national and international speakers.
