      <h2>Introduction to SBW2024</h2>
      <p>The Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop (SBW) is an annual event organized by different universities in Sweden since 2000. It is the largest gathering of bioinformaticians and computational biologists in Sweden. The event is targeted at and organized by PhD students and postdocs, but it's open to everyone working with any kind of bioinformatics or computational biology. <br><br>
        In 2024, we were happy to host the conference in Uppsala, on November 4-5 at The Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences. The SBW2024 was part of the Nordic Computational Biology (Nordic CompBio) week and open to participants from other Nordic countries.
        Visit <a href="https://www.nordic-compbio.org/events">Nordic CompBio</a> for more information on other regional programs, and future events.
