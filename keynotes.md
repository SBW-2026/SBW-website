        <p>Professor Ana Conesa and her group at the Spanish National Research Council creates the interface that translates raw big data into biological conclusions. Bioinformatical tool development is an increasingly crucial part of modern life science and will grow with the necessity for integrating multimodal data. Ana Conesa and her team have decided to address this necessity head-on by developing tools such as PaintOmics, MultiBaC, MORE, and more.</p>

        <p>Ann Nordgren is a Chief Physician and Professor in Clinical Genetics at Karolinska institute and University of Gothenburg working with rare disease diagnostics and child cancer. Among other things she is the main responsible for the national ChiCAP-study about genetic disposition for child cancer. She also organized the Undiagnosed Hackathon event, combining over 100 experts from 28 countries to help diagnose previously undiagnosed families using bioinformatics tools and analyses.</p>

        <p>Being Research Director at the Institute for Molecular Medicine at the University of Helsinki, Caroline Heckman plays a central role in guiding scientific research, much like the heart orchestrates the flow of blood. Working closely with the clinic, her research aims at understanding disease heterogeneity and drug resistance in blood cancers by applying genomic approaches, and translating the findings to patient care. She is tackling Leukemias by finding novel attack points, forcing differentiation or targeting the cell's innate DNA repair pathway.</p>
