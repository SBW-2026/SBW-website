      <p><i><center>Keynote speaker for the Cancer Genomics session</center></i></p>
        <p>Abhishek Niroula is associate professor at University of Gothenburg, with a research focus on clonal hematopoiesis and how it originates, evolves, and leads to disease (e.g. acute myeloid leukemia and cardiovascular disease). Clonal hematopoiesis is a premalignant condition where hematopoietic stem cells acquire somatic mutations that give rise to distinct clones, which can expand over time and increase the risk for hematologic malignancies. To uncover the mechanisms and factors behind this process, Abhishek leverages large-scale sequencing data and integration with multiomics data.</p>

      <p><i><center>Keynote speaker for the Multi-omics Data Integration session</center></i></p>
        <p>Professor Ana Conesa at the Spanish National Research Council creates the interface that translates raw big data into biological conclusions. Bioinformatical tool development is an increasingly crucial part of modern life science and will grow with the necessity for integrating multimodal data. Ana Conesa and her team have decided to address this necessity head-on by developing tools such as PaintOmics, MultiBaC, MORE, and more.</p>

      <p><i><center>Keynote speaker for the Metagenomics and Microbiology session</center></i></p>
        <p>Doctor Astrid von Mentzer is principal investigator at the University of Gothenburg, where she investigates how pathogenic E. coli spreads, adapts to host and causes disease. By applying computational genomic approaches and machine learning, Astrid and her group investigates E. coli pathogenesis, with the ultimate goal of identifying potential targets for diagnostics and vaccine development – an important part in combating the spread of resistant strains.</p>

      <p><i><center>Keynote speaker for the Cancer Genomics session</center></i></p>
        <p>Being Research Director at the Institute for Molecular Medicine at the University of Helsinki, Caroline Heckman plays a central role in guiding scientific research, much like the heart orchestrates the flow of blood. Working closely with the clinic, her research aims at understanding disease heterogeneity and drug resistance in blood cancers by applying genomic approaches, and translating the findings to patient care. She is tackling Leukemias by finding novel attack points, forcing differentiation or targeting the cell's innate DNA repair pathway.</p>

      <p><i><center>Keynote speaker for the Translational Research session</center></i></p>
        <p>Translating computational hypotheses and conclusions to clinical changes is fraught with challenges. These are challenges that Professor Erik Larsson Lekholm, at the University of Gothenburg, welcomes headfirst. From contributing to mechanistic insights into various cancers (e.g. melanoma, SINET) to elucidating the mitochondrial genome. The current undertaking is to translate the findings to clinical settings such as cancer screening panels and improvements in cancer diagnostics.</p>

      <p><i><center>Keynote speaker for the Metagenomics and Microbiology session</center></i></p>
        <p>Stefanie Prast-Nielsen is an Associate Professor (Docent) in Medical Microbiology and Senior Research Specialist at the Centre for Translational Microbiome Research, Karolinska Institutet. It is evident that diet and health have a strong connection, but there are few examples as good as the link between the ketogenic diet and drug resistant epilepsy. Despite this strong link, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Professor Stefanie Prast-Nielsen is working to uncover these mechanisms, bringing new insights into how the gut microbiome and metabolism affect brain activity and therapeutic possibilities.</p>
