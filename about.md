The Swedish Bioinformatics Workshop (SBW) is an annual event that has been organized by different universities in Sweden since 2000.  It is the biggest meeting of bioinformaticians and computational biologists in Sweden. This year, we are happy to announce that the event will take place in Uppsala on November 4 and 5, 2024,  at The Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Aula.

The event is targeted at, and organized by, PhD students and postdocs, but it’s open to everyone working with any kind of bioinformatics or computational biology. Senior scientists and non-academic participants are welcome. In addition, the SBW 2024 is part of the Nordic Computational Biology (Nordic CopmBio) week and is open to participants from other Nordic countries. Visit [Nordic CopmBio](https://www.nordic-compbio.org/events) for more information and updates on regional programmes.
